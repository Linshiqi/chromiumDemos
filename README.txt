## What's this about?

This is my learning note on Chromium source code.

My learning source are from :
- Chromium's official doc in its codebase.
- https://github.com/keyou/chromium_demo (Chromium 120 for this point)

The version of Chromium Here is 131.0.6778.70

The main content is :
- GN : the build tool of Chromium
- Message Loop : A very important concept of Chromium programming
- Mojo : a interprocess communication library wildly used in Chromium

Chromium is a very large and excellent c++ codebase to learn from, However I want to
focus only on its base library and mojo library which are not directly related to
Chromium's functons. So you can use them in other c++ project.
